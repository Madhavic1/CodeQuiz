  ### Introducion (Aim of the project) / General Information:
    The main aim of this project is to build an application that stores high scores on client-side. As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment.This application has multiple quizzes and an option for users to choose between them. These assessments are typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges.It is an application which is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. And also, this application alerts the user of correct or incorrect answers by giving 2 different audio cues.
     
     * Play proceeds as follows:


    - The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." There will be a  navigation option to "View        Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

    - Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins     countdown.

    - Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time       penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

    - When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their     final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
